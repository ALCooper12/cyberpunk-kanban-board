# Cyberpunk-Themed Kanban Board ü§ñ

It features a sleek, Cyberpunk-themed design in order to visualize the uniqueness and creativity from other similarly built applications. The functionality is a simple, but fun-to-use drag and drop mechanism of moving tasks from and to the current provided columns: On Hold, To Do, In Progress, Done, and Delete. Overall, I had a lot of fun making this and I hope you enjoy it!!

## Architecture Overview üèóÔ∏è

This Kanban Board Application was built using React for the frontend and Flask in the backend. The frontend is responsible for providing the user interface and the drag and drop functionality, while the backend handles data storage and management.

## Features üöÄ

The Kanban Board provides the following features:

-   Displays a list of tasks in any column (except the delete column)
-   Drag and Drop functionality of tasks into columns
-   Add a new task
-   Edit a task
-   Mark a task as completed
-   Delete a task

### Frontend

-   Framework: React
-   Languages: JavaScript
-   Styling: CSS and Bootstrap
-   Dependencies: [dnd kit](https://dndkit.com/) and React Router

### Backend

-   Framework: Flask
-   Languages: Python
-   Database: SQLite

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Backend Setup

1. **Activate Python Virtual Environment (Optional):** Now before you spin up your backend server, I recommend activating a Python virtual environment (I used Python 3.12.2) first! If you don't have one, you can create one by running the following command in the root directory of your project:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    then activate it by running:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

    If everything works out, you should see something like this in your terminal:

    ```bash
    (.venv) arianna@Ariannas-MBP
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Then you should navigate to the backend directory and install the required Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run Flask Server:** And finally start the Flask server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 run.py
    ```

    If everything works out, you should see something like this in your terminal:

    ```bash
    * Serving Flask app 'app'
    * Debug mode: on
    WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
    Press CTRL+C to quit
    * Restarting with stat
    * Debugger is active!
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Node.js:** If you haven't already, install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required Node.js dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Make a tiny change to 2 files:** Since this app is being deployed on Render, the `package.json` and `board.jsx` files need to be changed so that the app can be ran on your localhost ports 3000 and 5000 on your computer.

    First go to line 47 within `package.json` and change the proxy value:

    ```bash
    "proxy": "http://localhost:5000/"
    ```

    Next, uncomment out the code on line 24, and then comment out line 23 within the `board.jsx` file:

    ```bash
    //export const baseUrl = "https://cyberpunk-kanban-board-backend.onrender.com/";
    export const baseUrl = "http://localhost:5000/";
    ```

    Now you should be able to render the frontend on your localhost:3000 and the backend on your localhost:5000

4. **Run React Server:** Start the React server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Again, if everything goes well, you should see something like this in your terminal:

    ```bash
    Compiled successfully!

    You can now view frontend in the browser.

        Local:            http://localhost:3000
        On Your Network:  http://123.456.78.910:3000

    Note that the development build is not optimized.
    To create a production build, use npm run build.

    webpack compiled successfully
    ```

## Usage üñ•Ô∏è

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the UI by visiting [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your web browser.

Awesome! You're all set up now ü•≥ Have fun! üéâ
